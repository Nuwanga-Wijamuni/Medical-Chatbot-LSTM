Some of my friends suggested it might be an allergy…","From what you've described, it does seem like you may have had a severe allergic reaction, possibly something called anaphylaxis. Are you familiar with that term?"
,40-D," No, I've never heard of it. What does it mean?","Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can occur rapidly, often within minutes to hours after being exposed to an allergen, something you're allergic to.
